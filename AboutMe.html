                <h3>Early Life</h3>

                <p>Even as a young kid I always had a deep love for computers and the hardware associated with them. While the other kids was playing football. I was building my own PC's at just 12 years old with old hardware that I would find in junkyards, or in a storage building that I was helping clean just to try and get something working. I'm talking the old stuff, back when motherboards still had ide, AGP, and no pci express slots and pre ddr; the ram used was sdram. Where we had megabytes not gigabytes to work with. I still remember thinking how awesome it was when I found my first stick of 512mb sdram; I was so excited when it was compatible and the pc posted and booted up. Heck I even had a couple of motherboards that pre-dated pci slots and agp all together. Granted, I never got one of them to boot, but it wasn't for lack of effort.</p>

                <p>Here is an image of a vintage motherboard that is very similar to what i had and couldn't get it to work.</p>

                <h3>My current goals and ambitions</h3>

                <p>
                    My current short term goal is to complete my associates degree. I want to at some point receive my bachelors in Computer science. My long term goal is to become a part of the dev team for world of warcraft. Game Development is my first love. Video games is why I fell in love with computer programing in the first place, but its incredibly hard to land a game dev job. Web dev jobs are plentiful. So my plan is to work as a website developer while finishing up a bachelors in Computer science, and continue to grow my portfolio of games in the mean time.

                <h3>My Dream Vacation</h3>
                <p>I would love to at some point visit blizzcon in irvin california. It has always looked so cool, and I attend virtually every year. But my finances have never permitted me to actually go all the way across the country, and stay in one of the most expensive cities in the world. However, one day, just maybe I can finally go.</p>
