                        Home Page: This page will consist of a search bar to search for games of interest, also there will be a section for top rated games of the day.
                        If a top rated game img is clicked then the browser will be directed to the Game details webpage displaying the details of the clicked game.
                        I want to include links to the websites of my favorite games on the side bar.

                        Advanced Search Page: This page will have different filters that can be applied to the search, for instance someone might only want
                        to view FPS games. There will also be a link back to the home page from here.
